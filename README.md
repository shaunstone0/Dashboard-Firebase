# Mini Dashboard

> Built with React and firebase

Clone/Download repo and run `npm install` to get all necessary libraries.

inside the `src/components/Firebase` folder there is a file called `firebase.js`

this file will require the information provided by firebase to connect. this information can be found inside your Firebase Dashboard.

Once you have the project setup, it will only require you to have your data inside a **Realtime Database**.

I put the funds inside the database under `funds`

you can use my [Repo](https://github.com/shaunstone0/firebase-uploader) here if the information is inside a `.csv` file.
It will upload it to the proper place inside the database for this project.

Let me know if you have any further questions.
